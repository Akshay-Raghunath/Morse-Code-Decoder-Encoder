# Morse-Code-Decoder-Encoder

Morse Code is a very simple way of communication , It essentially only involves a dot and dash ('.' and '-' respectively). Combinations of these dots and dashes give us one alphabet of the English Alphabet(This is the traditional morse code, of course we can create modifications). 

For Eg: The letter A is characteristiced by a dot followed by a dash(A: ".-") , Similary B:"-..." etc.

In this project  I have used 4 push buttons , 4 leds  corresponding to each push button for the visual stimulus of the decoder. 
first push button signifies the dot , next one -the dash , third one -space and fourth one used for processing.
The user presses  the push buttons and corresponding text is displayed on the Arduino IDE Monitor. 

Additional Functionallites which could be incorporated are adding an LCD , which prints the human text as part of decoding or adding a speaker that reads out the converted  human text aloud.

I have used my knowledge in digital Electronics (For Circuit Assembly) , Embedded C( for the programming part) and Arduino fundamental concepts as I have used an Arduino UNO R3 micrcocontroller board for this project.
